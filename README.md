# RubikCube

Class project done in C++ Using DirectX9 Library
No solver included, only 3D programming, algorithm to move and to shuffle the cube are provided

This is an initial release. Will probably get upgraded because the inputs are quite terrible for the user right now.
At least the game can be played by having the right hand choosing the row, column, layer and having the left hand rotating
the block and the row, column, layer

WASD = Moves the camera around the cube
(Numpad) 1 2 3 = Are use to determine which of layer X1, X2, X3 is going to be rotated 
(Numpad) 4 5 6 = Are use to determine which of layer Y1, Y2, Y3 is going to be rotated 
(Numpad) 7 8 9 = Are use to determine which of layer Z1, Z2, Z3 is going to be rotated 
Q E = Are use to determine which side the selected layer is going to rotate to
SpaceBar + Left CTRL = Shuffle the cube -> added the Left CTRL to stop the player hitting unintentionally the shuffle button.

Hope you like it
